# home-page-project

Responsive animated home page based on the theme of travel in northern countries. Crafted with GSAP JavaScript library, and powered by React / Gatsby. Unfortunately this project is not suited for Safari.

# What I've learnt?

- I practiced React with hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, useContext...)
- I improved my web design skills, trying to make an original home page
- Using GSAP with React / Gatsby
- Creating more complex web animations thanks to GSAP
- Before rushing into this web animation project and code the idea I had in mind I should have checked ahead css properties on MDN in order to assess animation possibilities across different browsers. But I didn't do it and then after finishing coding this project I realized that 'clip-path' css property couldn't be animated into Safari. As a consequence this project is not suited for Safari. I guess this kind of error is part of the learning process...
